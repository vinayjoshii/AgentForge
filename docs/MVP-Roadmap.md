# 🧩 MVP Roadmap: AgentForge

Hey team! 👋  
This is where we kick things off.

We're building AgentForge — a platform that helps businesses get their own **personalized AI agents**.  
The goal right now is simple: **let's build a basic version that actually works**.

---

## 🚀 What the MVP Should Do

- A business should be able to **describe what kind of AI agent they need**
- We should be able to **create and run that agent with useful tools + memory**
- There should be a **simple dashboard** to see and manage those agents

That’s it. Clean and useful.

## 🔧 What We Need to Build (First)

### 🛠️ Backend (FastAPI or whatever works)
- [ ] An endpoint to create an agent
- [ ] Store agent config (could be JSON, a DB, Supabase — open to ideas)
- [ ] Connect it to a vector store (Pinecone, Supabase, etc.)
- [ ] Run a basic LangChain (or LlamaIndex) agent with 1–2 tools

### 🎨 Frontend (React + Tailwind preferred, but open)
- [ ] Simple dashboard UI
- [ ] A form to create an agent
- [ ] A page that shows agent logs / status / edit config

### 🧠 AI Agent
- [ ] Plug in a basic LLM via LangChain or similar
- [ ] Add 1 or 2 tools (search, calculator, Notion, etc.)
- [ ] Give it short-term memory (even local is fine for now)

---

## 💡 Nice-to-Haves (Stretch goals — not urgent)
- Slack or Notion integration
- Login/auth
- Basic billing or usage tracker
